# Graduate-School-Research
My foolish attempt to make graduate school application a little bit more engaging.

## Introduction
It's 10:56 p.m. and I'm exhausted from research, studying for the GRE, studying for classes, reading papers, and preparing my graduate school application. For some strange reason I really enjoy writing markdown files, so I thought it might be a good idea to start a repository where I keep records of the research I did in the search for a graduate school that will suite me. Hey it might even help somebody somewhere someday! So here goes nothing!

## What I am Looking for
1. What kind of professors teach at this university? What kind of research are they doing?
2. What kind of research opportunities are available at this university? e.g. Machine Learning Initiatives, Data Science Insitutes
