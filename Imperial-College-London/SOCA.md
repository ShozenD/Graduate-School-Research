1. Constructs a data sequence method that treats single tasks as node, which allows the exploration of temporal relationships between tasks. 

2. Introduce a novel Bayesian prbabilistic model that is capable of modelling trajectories. 

3. The introduced methods can help course creators understand in detail about the characterisitcs of their students as well as the characteristics of their course. For example, course creators can examine in detail where poorly performing students differ from top achieving students, which is useful in analyzing the differences between people who succeed or fail their course.
