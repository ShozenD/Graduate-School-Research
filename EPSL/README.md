### Basics
* Comprehensive education from foundation to implementation, from algorithms to database structure, and from information theory to machine learning. 
* Offered by the School of computer and communication sciences in collab with the School of basic sciences (mathematics) and the School of engineering (electrical engineering). 

## Swiss Data Science Center
### Basics
* Joint venture between EPFL and ETH Zurich
* Accelerate the adoption of data science and machine learning techniques
* Addresses the gap between those who create data, those who develop analytics and systems, and those who could potentially extract value from it. 

### Projects 2020
#### Generating counterfactuals for model robustness and explainability
* Causality and interpretability for machine learning i.e. how and why a model is making its predictions. 
* Explores the ideas of *counterfactuals*.  

#### Causal Explanations for Model Interpretation under Uncertainty
* Causality and interpretability for deep models
* Selecting causal features without influencing the predictive ability of the deep neural network

#### Mobility analysis using GPS data: the development of a privacy conscious data analytics pipeline

#### Variational autoencoders to disentangle climate signals
