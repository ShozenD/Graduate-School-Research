# Imperial College London
## MSc Statistics(Data Science)
### The Basics
* One-year full-time programme
* Provides outstanding training both in theoretical and applied statistics with a focus on Data Science
* Programme is split between taught **core** and **optional** moduels in the Autumn and Spring terms (66.67% weighting) and a **research project** in the Summer term (33.33% weighting).
* [Link to the homepage](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/postgraduate/msc/statistics/prospective/msc-statistics-data-science/)

The things taught in class can be learned at another college, through and online coursera course, or even on your own. Frankly, while it is helpful to see what classes you would be taking if you were accepted, anyone can write about these in their Statement of Purpose. 

## Data Science Institute
### The Basics
* One of the six Global Institues of Imperial College London, created to address important issues facing the world today (e.g. health inequities, global warming, opportunities created by big data and molecular engineering)

* Hosts researchers and students conducting their own academic research ona range of topics within the five crosscutting research themes of `Analytics`, `Biomedical Informatics`, `Data Learning`, `Image Informatics`, and `Visualization`. 

### Laboratories
#### Algorithmic Society Lab
* Provide leadership in the UK and beyond in the safe, anonymous, and ethical use of large-scale behavorial datasets coming from the Internet of Things(IoT) devices, mobile phones, credit cards and browsers. 

* **Their Mission** <ol>
    <li>The design of re-identification and profiling algorithms.
    <li>The development of safe, often interactive, mechanisms for the privacy-conscientious use of large-scale behavioral datasets.
    <li>The definition of formal properties and metrics of fairness in algorithmic-decision making and modern machine learning.
  </ol>

* **The People There** <ul>
    <li>Dr. Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye (Dept. of Computing)
    <li>Professor Emil Lupu
    <li>Dr. Thomas Heinis
    <li>Dr. Hamed Haddadi
    <li>Dr. Naranker Dulay
    <li>Ali Farzaneh Far(PhD candidate)
    <li>Andrea Gadotti(PhD candidate)
    <li>Florimond Houssiau(PhD candidate)
    <li>Luc Rocher(Research Associate)
  </ul>

* **First Impression**: All the professors are in the computer science department. Given that their work is mostly privacy related, this is unsurprising. As a Statistics student I should probably take a look at the other labs and come back to it later.

#### Behavorial Analytics Lab
* Predicting human and biological behaviour. The lab focuses in on tthe analysis of human behaviour using data-driven analysis and prediction, including the development of methods & algorithms to move from Big Data to Big Knowledge.

* Brings together academics from across all the faculties in Imperial College including `Computing`, `Bioengineering`, `Medicine`, `Neuroscience`, and `Electrical Engineering`

* **Thier Mission** 
  <ol>
    <li>Understand and predict human behaviour from ubiquitous sensors & digital data
    <li>Predict and evaluate human performance
    <li>Infer internal or cognitive state (stress, risk) of individuals from behavioural dynamics
    <li>Develop behavioural biomarkers of physiological and psychological well-being
    <li>Bottom-up analysis of group and social dynamics from the decisions of individuals
  </ol>

* **The People There** <ul>
    <li>Aldo Faisal (Dept. of Bioengineering & Dept. of Computing)
    <li>Firat GÃ¼der (Dept. of Bioengineering)
    <li>Yiannis Demiris (Dept. Electrical and Electronical Engineering)
    <li>Mauricio Barahona (Dept. of Mathematics)
    <li>Richard Festenstein (Faculty of Medicine)
    <li>Adam Hampshire (Faculty of Medicine)
    <li>Andre Brown (MRC CSC/Faculty of Medicine)
  </ul>

* **First Impression**: Initially, I though this laboratory was about using things such as smartphone data to research human behavior. However, after breifly reading the homepage, I get the impression that it is more about the brain.
